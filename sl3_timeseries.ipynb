Different machine learning algorithms are defined in classes that inherit from `Lrnr_base`. All learners (e.g., `Lrnr_arima`) inherit from this R6 class. We will use the term \"learners\" to refer to the family of classes that inherit from `Lrnr_base`. Learner objects can be constructed from their class definitions using the `make_learner` function (or more directly through invoking the `$new()` method). Let's now look at a simple time series learner, `Lrnr_arima`, which defines autoregressive integrated moving average model for univariate time-series."
