    "`sl3` is designed using basic OOP principles and the `R6` OOP framework. While we’ve tried to make it easy to use `sl3` without worrying much about OOP, it is helpful to have some intuition about how `sl3` is structured. In this section, we briefly outline some key concepts from OOP. Readers familiar with OOP basics are invited to skip this section. The key concept of OOP is that of an object, a collection of data and functions that corresponds to some conceptual unit. Objects have two main types of elements: (1) _fields_, which can be thought of as nouns, are information about an object, and (2) _methods_, which can be thought of as verbs, are actions an object can perform. Objects are members of classes, which define what those specific fields and methods are. Classes can inherit elements from other classes (sometimes called base classes) – accordingly, classes that are similar, but not exactly the same, can share some parts of their definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many different implementations of OOP exist, with variations in how these concepts are implemented and used. R has several different implementations, including `S3`, `S4`, reference classes, and `R6`. `sl3` uses the `R6` implementation. In `R6`, methods and fields of a class object are accessed using the `$` operator. The next section explains how these concepts are used in `sl3` to model machine learning problems and algorithms."
